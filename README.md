# Solutions to Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Rudin

This work has been read by thousands and has solutions written by many as well.

Yet why write more? Just to add some student spice to it. What this means is I'll add my thoughts about each chapter, some hints that might help someone learning, and any other notes that can help with the understanding of the text. 

I'm just reading this for fun so idk if I'll even finish this, and I don't plan to write super comprehensive solutions for everything.

The PDF is located in the [`build/`](build/main.pdf) folder of the repo.

## Prereqs

Despite Baby Rudin being an "intro to analysis," if you have no prior analysis experience, you should look for an even simpler intro such as [Understanding Analysis by Abbott](https://amzn.to/3wXODiO) ([solutions by me here](https://github.com/mikinty/Understanding-Analysis-Abbott-Solutions)).
