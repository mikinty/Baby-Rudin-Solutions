# Solutions to Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Rudin

This work has been read by thousands and has solutions written by many as well.

Yet why write more? Just to add some student spice to it. What this means is I'll add my thoughts about each chapter, some hints that might help someone learning, and any other notes that can help with the understanding of the text. 

I'm just reading this for fun so idk if I'll even finish this, and I don't plan to write super comprehensive solutions for everything.
